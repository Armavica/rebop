        """Add a reaction to the system.

        Reaction rates can be specified with a number (for a reaction obeying
        the Law of Mass Action) or a string (for an arbitrary reaction rate).
        The string can involve any species involved in reactions, and also
        parameters defined with the `params` argument of the `run` method.

        If you can, use the law of mass action, which is probably going to be
        more efficient and can be more correct. For example, for a dimerisation
        equation:

        ```python
        s = Gillespie()
        # Correct, and recommended
        s.add_reaction(4.2, ["A", "A"], ["AA"])
        # Correct, but not recommended
        s.add_reaction("4.2 * A * (A-1)", ["A", "A"], ["AA"])
        # Incorrect (this would be a constant propensity)
        s.add_reaction("4.2", ["A", "A"], ["AA"])
        # Incorrect (incorrect expression)
        s.add_reaction("4.2 * A^2", ["A", "A"], ["AA"])
        ```

        Example
        -------
        ```python
        s = Gillespie()
        # Add the birth equation Ã¸ -> A at rate 14
        s.add_reaction(14, [], ["A"])
        # Add the reversible reaction A + B -> C
        # with forward rate 0.1 and reverse rate 0.01
        s.add_reaction(0.1, ["A", "B"], ["C"], 0.01)
        # Add the transformation B -> C with a non-LMA rate
        s.add_reaction("2.1 * B * A / (5 + A)", ["B"], ["C"])
        # Add the transformation B -> C with a non-LMA rate and parameters
        # that need to be defined by passing `params={"k": 2.1, "K_A": 5}` to
        # the method `run`
        s.add_reaction("k * B * A / (K_A + A)", ["B"], ["C"])
        ```

        Parameters
        ----------
        rate : float | str
            If numeric, this is the rate constant of a Law of Mass Action.
            If string, this is the mathematical expression of the reaction rate.
        reactants : Sequence[str]
            List of the species that are on the left-hand-side of the reaction.
        products : Sequence[str]
            List of the species that are on the right-hand-side of the reaction.
        reverse_rate : float | str | None
            Rate of the reverse reaction, if this reaction is reversible.
            This is just a convenience to avoid using `add_reaction` a second
            time for the reverse reaction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        init : Mapping[str, int]
            Dictionary that indicates the initial condition. It can omit
            species, their initial number will be 0.
        tmax : float
            Simulation end time.
        nb_steps : int
            Number of steps to return, equally distributed between 0 and `tmax`.
            If 0, then all reactions are returned.
        params : Mapping[str, float] | None
            Dictionary of values for the parameters that appear in the rates.
        rng : RNGLike | SeedLike | None
            Numpy `Generator`, `BitGenerator` or seed.
        sparse : bool | None
            Whether to internally represent reactions as dense or sparse.
            Sparse reactions will tend to be faster for systems with many
            species. If `None`, rebop will choose depending on heuristics.
        var_names : Sequence[str] | None
            List of variable names to return, if one does not want to save
            all variables. If `None`, all variables will be saved.

        Returns
        -------
